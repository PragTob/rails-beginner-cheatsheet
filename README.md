Rails Beginner Cheatsheet
=========================

A cheatsheet for Rails beginners, taking care of a lot of basic stuff and information. Aimed at helping beginners to look up stuff.

You can view this cheatsheet in all its "beauty" here: http://pragtob.github.io/rails-beginner-cheatsheet/

As opposed to other cheat sheets it isn't necessarily aimed at brevity, but comprehensibility. It also takes care of the very basics, like cd on the command line, that beginners sometimes forget or confuse.

Originally created for my RailsGirls project group, as it became apparent that it would be cool to be able to have a place to look up the common stuff.
