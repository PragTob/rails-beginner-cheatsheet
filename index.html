<h1>Cheat Sheet Conventions</h1>

<p>
  <strong>Bold</strong> words are what is really important e.g.
  the command and concept shown in the usage category. In the code usage and
  example columns these highlight the main part of the concept, like this:
  <code>general_stuff<strong>.concept</strong></code>.
  In the same columns <code><em>italic_words</em></code> mark the
  arguments/parameters of a command/method.
</p>

<p>
  However <em>italic words</em> in the descriptions or general text denote
  more general concepts or concepts explained elsewhere in this cheat
  sheet or in general.
</p>

<h1 id="console">Console Basics</h1>

<p>
  The console (also called <em>command line, command prompt or
  terminal</em>) is just another way of interacting with your computer.
  So you can basically do anything with it that you could also do with
  your graphical desktop user interface. This sections contains a couple
  of examples.
</p>

<p>
  For the different operating systems <strong>starting the console</strong>
  differs.
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Windows:</strong> Open the start menu and search for
    command prompt. Alternatively choose <em>execute</em> and enter
    <em>cmd</em>.</li>
  <li><strong>Mac:</strong> Open Spotlight, type <em>terminal</em>, and
    start that program.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Linux:</strong> The terminal should be one of the main
    options once you open the main menu of your distribution. Otherwise
    search for <em>terminal</em> if your distribution has such an option
    or look under Accessories.
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="ruby">Ruby Basics</h1>

<p>
  Ruby is the programming language Ruby on Rails is written in. So most
  of the time you will be writing Ruby code. Therefore it is good to
  grasp the basics of Ruby. If you just want to play with Ruby, type
  <strong>irb</strong> into your console to start interactive ruby. There
  you can easily experiment with Ruby. To leave irb, type
  <strong>exit</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  This is just a very small selection of concepts. This is especially
  true later on when we talk about what Arrays, Strings etc. can do.

  search engine!

    </p>
  </td>
  <td>
    Ruby ignores everything that is marked as a comment. It does not try
    to execute it. Comments are just there for you as information.
    Comments are also commonly used to <em>comment out code</em>. That
    is when you don't want some part of your code to execute
    but you don't want to delete it just yet, because you are trying
    different things out.

<strong>sum</strong> # => 23</code></pre>
  </td>
  <td>
    With a variable you tell Ruby that from now on you want to refer to
    that value by the name you gave it. So for the first example, from
    now on when you use <em>name</em> Ruby will know that you meant
    <em>"Tobi"</em>.

  </td>
  <td>
    <p>Calling a method is also often referred to as
      <em>sending a message</em> in Ruby. Basically we are sending an
      object some kind of message and are waiting for its response.
      This message may have no arguments or multiple arguments, depending
      on the message.
      So we kindly ask the object to do something or give us some
      information.
      When you "call a method" or "send a message" something happens. In the
      first example we ask a String how long it is (how many
      characters it consists of). In the last example we substitute all
      occurrences of "ae" in the string with the German "Ã¤".</p>

    <p>
      Different kinds of objects (Strings, Numbers, Arrays...)
      understand different messages.

    <p>Methods are basically reusable units of behaviour. And you can
      define them yourself just like this. Methods are small and focused
      on implementing a specific behaviour.</p>

      Our example method is focused on greeting people.

  </td>
  <td>
    <p>With if-clauses you can decide based upon a <em>condition</em>
      what to do. When the condition is considered true, then the code
      after it is executed. If it is considered false, the code after
      the "else" is executed.</p>

    <p>
      In the example, access is granted based upon the decision if a
      given input matches the password.

  </td>
  <td>
    Constants look like variables, just in UPCASE. Both hold
    values and give you a name to refer to those values. However while
    the value a variable holds may change or might be of an unknown
    value (if you save user input in a variable) constants are
    different. They have a known value that should never change. Think
    of it a bit like mathematical or physical constants. These don't
    change, they always refer to the same value.

<h2 id="ruby-hashes">Hashes</h2>

<p>
  Hashes associate a <em>key</em>  to some <em>value</em>. You may then retrieve the value based upon its key.
  This construct is called a <em>dictionary</em> in other languages, which is appropriate
  because you use the key to "look up" a value, as you would look up a definition for
  a word in a dictionary. Each key must be unique for a given hash but values can be repeated.
</p>

<p>
  Hashes can map from anything to anything! You can map from Strings to
  Numbers, Strings to Strings, Numbers to Booleans... and you can mix
  all of those! Although it is common that at least all the keys are of
  the same class. <em>Symbols</em> are especially common as keys. Symbols
  look like this: <code>:symbol</code>. A symbol is a colon followed by some
  characters. You can think of them as special strings that stand for
  (symbolize) something! We often use symbols because
  Ruby runs faster when we use symbols instead of strings.

    <td>
      You create a hash by surrounding the key-value pairs with curly
      braces. The arrow always goes from the <em>key</em> to the
      <em>value</em> depicting the meaning: <em>"This key points to this
      value."</em>. Key-value pairs are then separated by commas.

hash<strong>[</strong>foo<strong>]</strong> # => nil
</code></pre>
    </td>
    <td>
      Accessing an entry in a hash looks a lot like accessing it in
      an <em>array</em>. However with a hash the key can be anything, not
      just numbers. If you try to access a key that does not exist, the
      value <code>nil</code> is returned, which is Ruby's way of saying
      "nothing", because if it doesn't recognize the key it can't return
      a value for it.

hash<strong>[</strong>:key<strong>] =</strong> "value"
hash # => {:a=>"b", :key=>"value"}
</code></pre>
    </td>
    <td>
      Assigning values to a hash is similar to assigning values to an
      array. With a hash, the key can
      be a number or it can be a symbol, string,
      number... or anything, really!

<h1 id="rails">Rails Basics</h1>

<p>This is an introduction to the basics of Rails. We look at the general
  structure of a Rails application and the important commands used in the terminal.
</p>

<p>
  If you do not have Rails installed yet, there is a

<h2 id="rails-folder-structure">The Structure of a Rails app</h2>
Here is an overview of all the folders of a new Rails application, outlining
the purpose of each folder, and describing the most important files.
<table class="table table-striped">
  <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>app</td>
    <td>This folder contains your application. Therefore it is the
      <strong>most important folder</strong> in Ruby on Rails and it is
      worth digging into its subfolders. See the following rows.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>app/assets</td>
    <td>Assets basically are your front-end stuff. This folder contains
      <em>images</em> you use on your website, <em>javascripts</em> for
      all your fancy front-end interaction and <em>stylesheets</em> for
      all your CSS making your website absolutely beautiful.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>app/controllers</td>
    <td>The controllers subdirectory contains the controllers, which
      handle the requests from
      the users. It is often responsible for a single resource type,
      such as places, users or attendees. Controllers also tie together
      the <em>models</em> and the <em>views</em>.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>app/helpers</td>
    <td>Helpers are used to take care of logic that is needed in the views
      in order to keep the views clean of logic and reuse that logic in
      multiple views.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>app/mailers</td>
    <td>Functionality to send emails goes here.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>app/models</td>
    <td>The models subdirectory holds the classes that model the business
      logic of our application. It is concerned with the things our
      application is about. Often this is data, that is also saved in the
      database. Examples here are a Person, or a Place class with all
      their typical behaviour.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>app/views</td>
    <td>
      <p>The views subdirectory contains the display templates that will
        be displayed to the user after a successful request.
        By default they are written in HTML with embedded ruby
        (.html.erb). The embedded ruby is used to insert data from the
        application. It is then converted to HTML and sent to the browser
        of the user. It has subdirectories for every resource of our
        application, e.g. places, persons. These subdirectories contain the
        associated view files.</p>

      <p>Files starting with an underscore (<em>_</em>) are called
        <em>partials</em>. Those are parts of a view which are reused in
        other views. A common example is <em>_form.html.erb</em> which
        contains the basic form for a given resource. It is used in the
        <em>new</em> and in the <em>edit</em> view since creating
        something
        and editing something looks pretty similar.
      </p>

  <tr>
    <td>config</td>
    <td>This directory contains the configuration files that your
      application will need, including your database configuration (in
      <em>database.yml</em>) and the particularly important
      <em>routes.rb</em> which decides how web requests are handled.
      The <em>routes.rb</em> file matches a given URL with the
      <em>controller</em> which will handle the request.
    </td>

  <tr>
    <td>db</td>
    <td>Contains a lot of <em>database</em> related files.
      Most importantly the <em>migrations</em> subdirectory, containing
      all your database migration files. Migrations set up your
      database structure, including the attributes of your models. With migrations
      you can add new attributes to existing models or create new models.
      So you could add the <em>favorite_color</em> attribute to your
      Person model so everyone can specify their favorite color.

    <td>A folder for software code provided by others ("libraries"). Most
      often, libraries are provided as <em>ruby gems</em> and
      installed using the <em>Gemfile</em>. If code is not available as
      a ruby gem then you should put it here. This might be the case for
      jQuery plugins. Probably won't be used that often in the beginning.

      <p>If you want to add a new gem to your application,

<h2 id="rails-commands">Important Rails commands</h2>

<p>
  Here is a summary of important commands that can be used as you develop
  your Ruby on Rails app. You must be in the root directory of your project
  to run any of these commands (with the exception of the <em>rails new</em>
  command). The project or application root directory is the folder containing
  all the subfolders described above (app, config, etc.).

    <td>Create a new Ruby on Rails application with the given name here.
      This will give you the basic structure to immediately get started.
      After this command has successfully run your application is in a

      <em>cd</em> into that folder.

        The scaffold command magically generates all the common things needed
        for a new resource for you! This includes <em>controllers, models and views</em>. It
        also creates the following basic actions: create a new resource,
        edit a resource, show a resource, and delete a resource.
      </p>

      <p>That's all the basics you need. Take this example:</p>

      <p><code><strong>rails generate scaffold</strong> <em>product
        name:string price:integer</em></code></p>

      <p>Now you can create new products, edit them, view them and delete

<h2 id="rails-erb">ERB: Embedded Ruby</h2>
<p>
  In your views (that is, under <code>app/views</code> in your Rails app) you
  will find <code>.html.<strong>erb</strong></code> files. <strong>ERB</strong>
  stands for <strong>E</strong>mbedded <strong>R</strong>u<strong>B</strong>y.
  This just means that Rails processes some special tags in those files and
  produces HTML output to send back to the user.
</p>
<p>
  There are two ERB tags that you need to remember:
  <code>&lt;%= <i>ruby_code</i> %&gt;</code> and
  <code>&lt;% <i>ruby_code</i> %&gt;</code>. Notice that the difference is the
  <strong>=</strong> in the first tag.
</p>

<table class="table table-striped">
  <tr>
    <th class="usage">Tag</th>
    <th class="erb-example">Examples</th>
    <th class="description">Description</th>

    <td><code>&lt;%<strong>=</strong> %&gt;</code></td>
    <td><code><strong>&lt;%= @product.price %&gt;</strong></code></td>
    <td>
      It runs the Ruby code and inserts the result to the HTML at that position.
      You can put <em>any kind of Ruby code</em> between <code>&lt;%=</code> and
      <code>%&gt;</code>, for instance, <code>&lt;%= 9 * 3 %&gt;</code> will translate to
      <strong>27</strong> in the page that the user is viewing. However,
      typically this tag is used to display some data from a model, such as the
      price of a product, as shown in the example here.
    </td>

  <tr>
    <td><code>&lt;% %&gt;</code></td>

<pre><code><strong>&lt;% if user.admin? %&gt;</strong>
  &lt;p&gt;Hello Admin!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;</code></pre></td>
    <td>
      The Ruby code between the delimiters <code>&lt;%</code> and <code>%&gt;</code>
      is run but the result will <strong>not</strong> be inserted at this point
      in the HTML. Therefore these tags are most commonly used for control flow
      structures such as an if statement in the example, or loops.

<h1 id="help">Help: What to do when things go wrong?</h1>

<p>
  Things go wrong all the time. Don't worry, this happens to everyone.
  So keep calm. When you encounter an error, just google the error message.
  For best results, add the keywords "rails" or "ruby". Results from
  <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ruby-on-rails?sort=newest">stackoverflow.com</a>
  are often really helpful. Look for those! The most experienced developers do this frequently ;-).
  </p>

<p>
  Here are common mistakes with a little checklist:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have you run <em>rake db:migrate</em> to apply the newest database
    migrations?
  </li>
  <li>Have you really saved the file you just changed? Unsaved files are
    often marked in the editor via an asterisk or a point next to their
    name.
  </li>
  <li>If you just added a gem to the Gemfile, have you run <em>bundle
    install</em> to install it?
  </li>
  <li>If you just installed a gem, have you restarted the server?</li>
</ul>
