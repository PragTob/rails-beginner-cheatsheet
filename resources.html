<p>
  The Rails Beginner Cheat sheet isn't a substitution for a tutorial or other
  resources. It is meant to complement other resources and help you.
  This page is aimed at showing you more in depth guides to Ruby and Rails. The resources here have a couple of things in common: They are
  <strong>free and suitable for beginners!</strong>
</p>

<h2>Recommended resources</h2>
<p>
  A list of recommended resources to learn Ruby and Rails. If you know a
  tutorial you think should absolutely be in this list, please say so! Feedback

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong><a href="http://ruby.railstutorial.org/ruby-on-rails-tutorial-book">
    Michael Hartl's Ruby on Rails Tutorial Book</a></strong>
    One of the best Ruby on Rails
    tutorials out there - almost unbelievable that it's free.
    Michael Hartl leads you through the whole process of
    setting up Ruby on Rails, teaches you the basics of Ruby and then develops
    a Twitter like Web application with you. All of this with Test Driven
    Development. It’s also how I learned Rails ;-).
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="http://railscasts.com/"><strong>RailsCasts</strong></a> Ryan Bates
    makes an awesome job of shortly explaining Ruby on Rails features or
    introducing gems (= little bundles of functionality)
    via awesome screen casts. Often he takes you step by step
    through the journey of accomplishing a specific task. his is how a lot of
    developers learn about cool gems or features.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/"><strong>JumpstartLab
    tutorials</strong></a> JumpstartLab does Ruby and Ruby on Rails trainings
    and workshops. They share all their material for free online! They also have
    a <a href="http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/topics/index.html">list with
    more specific topics</a>. Awesome!
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/"><strong>Ruby on Rails

    everything about Rails ranging from beginner topics to more advanced
    topics.

    <strong><a href="http://www.codecademy.com">Codecademy</a></strong>
    A great interactive place to learn about JavaScript, basics of web pages
    (HTML + CSS), Python and of course
    <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/ruby">Ruby</a>. The site is very
    interactive, so you get straight to the exercises right in your browser.
    Plus you can track your progress and earn badges. I love badges, don't you?
