      <p>
        Hi there! So you are just starting with Rails? That's great!
        And then this place is for you. It summarizes some of the most important
        information about Ruby on Rails for your reference.
        Those things that you tend to forget
        especially in the beginning like: <em>How do I start the server?</em>
        and <em>What was that config directory for again?</em>.
        Furthermore it is directly aimed at beginners so contrary to common
        concise cheat sheets it contains rather verbose descriptions of some
        concepts. I think it can be of help for all people who just
        started with Ruby and Rails, no matter if they are experienced software
        developers or total beginners. Although it is mainly aimed at the latter
        group :-)
      </p>
      <p>
        A word of warning: This is the first release of this cheat sheet
        so it <em>may contain inaccuracies or even faults.</em> However accuracy
        isn't the first concern of this cheat sheet. Simplicity is. I want to
        help people get started with Ruby and Rails, not confuse them with every
        edge case you can think of.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is not meant to be a complete guide to Ruby on Rails. If you are
        looking for more information, I keep a list of good resources for
        learning Ruby and Rails (among other things)
        <a href="http://pragtob.wordpress.com/resources/">at my blog.</a>
      </p>

      <h2>Crator and Maintainer</h2>
      <p>
        This cheat sheet is proudly brought to you by Tobias Pfeiffer. However
        please call me Tobi and on the Internet I'm mostly known as
        <em>PragTob</em>. I originally built this for my
        <a href="http://railsgirlsberlin.de/">Rails Girls Berlin</a> project
        group, but I believe a lot of people getting into Rails can benefit from
        it.
